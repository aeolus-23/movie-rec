# Movie Recommendation

## Description
Automatically retrieves the top movies for the day on IMDB and randomly selects one for you to watch tonight. 

Movie Recommender is designed to use with IMDb lists (e.g. https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250). It will then build dictionaries for movies it finds or movies that
are randomly selected. 

Movie Recommender can write these movie data to JSON for faster access later.
