# Movie Recommendation

## Description
Automatically retrieves the top movies for the day on IMDB and randomly selects one for you to watch tonight. 
This is a (very) simple and limited program. It's also my first real program I've written!

## Usage
Movie Recommender currently is currently only working with the online movie recommendations. Simply launch mvoie_rec.py from the terminal and follow the prompts (only Quickstart, Online Movie Recommendations, and Exit work for now). 
You can still use the functions in web_scrape.py to build a JSON file from a movie list, but you can't access these from the terminal UI. 

## TODO
Finish the offline movie recommender functionality by:
- Adding corresponding functions to the UI
- Adding function to check for exiting JSON files 
- Allowing users to select their file from the .\data folder to recommend a movie
